Constraints:
1. We need to remove duplicates form an array without using extra space.

2. Also we need to do modifications to the same array so that (let's say if K elements are unique) 
   first k elements of the array should contain the unique elements 

Approach:
1. We will be using two pointer approach
2. Right pointer will keep scaning throughout the array whereas left pointer will point to the index where next unique elements should be placed.
3. In a way, left pointer  will tell us the number of unique characters as well.


Solution :

int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        
       int left=1, right=1;
        
        while(right<nums.size())
        {
            if(nums[right]==nums[right-1])
           {
               right++;
           }
            else
            {
                nums[left]=nums[right];
                left++;
                right++;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
