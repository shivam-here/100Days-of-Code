Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Constraint
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.


Approach 
1. We can use XOR operation. The trick is : A^B^A=B or A^B^A^C^D^C^D = B


Solution

int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        int ans=nums[0];
        
        for(int i=1;i<nums.size();i++)
        {
            ans=ans^nums[i];
        }
        return ans;
        
    }
